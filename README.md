This is a project on my Masters in Data Science for the course "Advanced Machine Learning". It was a kaggle competition on which me and my colleague managed to finish in the second place.
The goal for the competition was to detect pneumonia from X-Rays. After various attempts, we ended up using 2 pretrained models, the "EfficientNet B0" and the "DenseNet 121". We froze different
amounts of layers depending on the pretrained model and used ensemble for 4 models. The result was a Machine Learning model with accuracy of almost 85%.
